    abstract = {Rust is a promising compiled programming language that has
                gained in popularity in recent years, as well as support from
                corporations. It allows one to create efficient code, but it also
                provides a higher level of security and predictability. However,
                its GPU programming ecosystem is quite young and may be inferior
                to the classical C/C++ ecosystem in both performance and
                programmer friendliness, as well as in the range of features
                provided. Nevertheless, the Rust language model theoretically
                allows extensive optimization capabilities available to
                functional programming languages in particular, and the semantics
                of the language simplifies and secures code when properly
                applied. In this paper, we will explore the theoretical
                capabilities of the Rust language in GPU programming and compare
                the performance of Rust with C++ in the CUDA ecosystems using
                benchmarks.},
